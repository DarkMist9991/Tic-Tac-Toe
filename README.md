# Tic-Tac-Toe
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project was to make a Tic-Tac-Toe game with two game modes: Single Player against computer and Double Player. It was not really solving anything it was just a project I took up to practice JavaScript skills.
What did you do particularly well?
  I think I coded the JS part of the project pretty well as first timer, using functions and comments to make the code better. 
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I think the code could be a bit efficient, the CSS can use a little clean up and some of the variable names could be better. I also need to add better alert system then the deafult HTML one. 
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  I wrote the Tic-Tac-Toe program in python a few years ago and so that was the backbone of the logic. However at that time I was not using any GUI hence I foudn it a bit difficult to integrate the HTML here with the old python logic. I used simple logic and thinking to tackle this.   
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  The JS language will be trasnferable for any future web development projects.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I did use comments where ever I could but I think they still need some more clear comments for better understanding. First I only made the Single Player mode since I thought it would be easier however now that look back Double Player would have been easier to make first and it would have made the code more adapable.
